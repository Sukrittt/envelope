/**
 * Which fields are encrypted, per collection (lib/scoped.ts) — and nothing
 * else, deliberately: this file has zero imports so scripts/encrypt-existing.mjs
 * can import it directly under plain Node (`node --experimental-strip-types`),
 * which — unlike Next's bundler-mode resolution — needs an explicit .ts
 * extension on every hop, including this file's own. Importing lib/scoped.ts
 * itself from the script would drag in its `./crypto` import, which lacks
 * that extension (correctly, since every other file in this codebase omits
 * it) and Node's loader can't resolve.
 *
 * `'messages.text'` means "the `text` field inside each element of the
 * `messages` array" — the one nested case, handled specially wherever this
 * map is consumed.
 *
 * Deliberately not encrypted, because each is a filter/sort/index key: on
 * `expenses` — date, category, payment_method, timestamp, ai_scanned*; on
 * `budgets` — month, category; `categories`/`groups`/`category_map_overrides`
 * entirely (name/word are unique-index filter keys); `subscriptions.service`
 * and `holdings.name` (also filter keys — a future re-key to `_id` could move
 * them into this list); `chat_sessions.updatedAt` (sort + index).
