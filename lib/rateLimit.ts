/**
 * Sliding-window rate limiter backed by Mongo, so it survives cold starts and
 * is shared across serverless instances — unlike a per-instance in-memory Map
 * (the shape app/api/ai/chat/route.ts used before this existed).
 *
 * One document per hit rather than an array-per-key: a TTL index on `ts`
 * (see scripts/ensure-indexes.mjs) garbage-collects old hits automatically,
 * so there's no pruning logic here — `countDocuments` with a `$gte` cutoff is
 * always correct regardless of how stale the TTL cleanup is running behind.
 *
 * `opts` accepts one tier or several checked against the same hit log (e.g. a
 * short burst window plus a longer hourly one) — every hit is one real event,
 * so all tiers share a single insert rather than each tier maintaining its
 * own count and multiplying the insert rate.
 *
 * Not perfectly atomic under concurrent requests for the same key (a count
 * then an insert, not a single atomic op) — a burst of parallel requests can
 * overshoot the limit by a few. Accepted: this is an abuse-rate control on a
 * low-traffic personal app, not a hard billing quota.
