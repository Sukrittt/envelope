/**
 * Jev reads the user's chat messages (and nothing else) to decide two things
 * before Gemini is called: whether the message is even about this user's
 * money, and which slices of the FACTS text the answer needs. The raw
 * transaction rows are most of that text, so leaving them out when the
 * question is about totals cuts the Gemini prompt by roughly five times.
 *
 * The latest message is routed with the user's previous turns as context:
 * alone, a follow-up like "It's 12k." looks like neither a decision nor a
 * money question.
 *
 * Routing needs no user data, so it runs in parallel with the database read
 * and costs no extra wall-clock time.
