/**
 * Every API route must be a deliberate decision: gated behind a subscription,
 * or explicitly open. The failure mode this exists to prevent is silent — a
 * route added six months from now that nobody remembers to gate, leaking full
 * app access to an expired account, with no test going red to say so.
 *
 * A new route fails this test until it is either given `requireAccess` or
 * listed below with a reason. That is the point: the list is the record of
 * why each open route is open.
