/**
 * Recurring-expense schedule math. Pure, no I/O — same reasoning as
 * `subscriptions.ts` and `holdingRecurrence.ts`: the cron
 * (`app/api/notifications/run`), the CRUD route and the tests all need this,
 * and none of them should drag in Mongo to get it.
 *
 * Two things this does that the two older engines don't:
 *
 * 1. **It backfills.** `isSubscriptionDueToday` / `isDueToday` fire only on an
 *    exact match with today, so a skipped cron run loses that period for good.
 *    `occurrencesDue` returns *every* occurrence from `next_run_date` through
 *    today, so each missed date still gets logged on its own date.
 * 2. **Monthly clamps without drifting.** `subscriptions.ts::rollForward` uses
 *    raw `Date` setters, so a 31st recurrence overflows Jan 31 → Mar 3. Here a
 *    short month clamps to its last day, and the *anchor* day (from
 *    `start_date`) is what the next step is computed from — so Jan 31 →
 *    Feb 28 → Mar 31, not Feb 28 → Mar 28.
 *
 * Dates are 'YYYY-MM-DD' compared at UTC midnight, never a live instant — the
 * bug `subscriptions.ts` documents at length, where a recurrence due *today*
 * reads as already past.
