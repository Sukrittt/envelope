/**
 * Refreshes the sealed AuthKit session cookie, and sends signed-out visitors on
 * app routes (APP_PATHS) to this app's own /sign-in page.
 *
 * This app never uses WorkOS's hosted AuthKit UI — Google goes straight to
 * Google's consent screen and email uses magic-auth codes, both via
 * `app/api/auth/*`, both calling `saveSession()` directly (see lib/access.ts's
 * header comment). That means the library's built-in `middlewareAuth` option
 * doesn't fit here: enabling it redirects signed-out visitors to WorkOS's
 * hosted authorize URL, not to this app's own `/sign-in` page, and this app
 * has no route handler at the redirect URI it would need. Authentication is
 * therefore initiated explicitly from the app's own sign-in page.
 *
 * Every API route
 * resolves its own auth via `lib/access.ts::getAuth`, which falls back to
 * the read-only demo user (`DEMO_USER_ID`) for anyone with *no* credential
 * at all. That stays as-is — it's the fallback for API callers that bypass
 * the browser (tests, curl, direct requests). Pages no longer render that demo:
 * app routes redirect to /sign-in above.
 *
 * One exception: a request that *does* carry a Bearer token (the mobile
 * app's normal case — it always sends one once signed in) but whose token
 * fails WorkOS verification is 401'd right here, before it ever reaches a
 * route handler. That case is a broken real session (expired refresh,
 * revoked elsewhere, clock skew), not a guest — letting it fall through to
 * `getAuth`'s demo fallback would silently render the demo account's data
 * under a real, still-appears-signed-in user with no error anywhere. The
 * mobile client already has 401-triggered logout wired up
 * (`app/_layout.tsx`'s query-cache listener); this is what feeds it. The cron
 * paths are exempt from that gate — see `CRON_PATHS` above.
