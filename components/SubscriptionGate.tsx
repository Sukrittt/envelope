 * Routes that show the budgeting app itself. Only these are replaced when the

 *
 * An allowlist, not a blocklist, and that direction is the whole point: a
 * route added later is reachable by default rather than silently locked. The
 * server is what actually enforces this (lib/billing/guard.ts) — getting this
 * list wrong shows someone an empty screen, not someone else's data.
 *
 * Everything else stays open on purpose: the landing page, sign-in,
 * onboarding, /admin, and the /account pages an expired user has to keep:
 * data (export), security (sign out, delete), help, feedback and the tour.
 * The /account hub itself is gated: it's a menu into budgeting features, and
 * the lock screen lists those exit routes instead.
