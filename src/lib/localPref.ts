/**
 * Device-local UI preferences. Web counterpart of the `expo-secure-store`
 * calls in Mobile's preference hooks (useCollapsedGroups, useRecentCategories,
 * useTourProgress, useDismissedRolloverBanner).
 *
 * Two deliberate differences from the mobile twins:
 *
 * 1. Reads stay async-shaped even though localStorage is synchronous. Reading
 *    during render would desync server and client markup — the same trap
 *    AppearanceProvider documents — so the hooks hydrate in an effect exactly
 *    as mobile's do, and the shapes stay diffable.
 *
 * 2. Mobile clears these through `accessMode.subscribeLogout`. Web signs out
 *    by navigating to /logout, so there is no in-page event to subscribe to
 *    and localStorage survives the navigation. `clearLocalPrefs()` below is
 *    that guard, called from the sign-out controls before they navigate.
 *    Without it the next account signed into this browser inherits the
 *    previous one's collapsed groups and recently-used categories.
 *
 * Every key is prefixed so clearLocalPrefs can find them all without a
 * registry to keep in sync.
