const FAQS = [
  { q: 'Why give your money a job?', a: 'Your bank balance includes money for rent, groceries, future plans, and fun. Assigning it to envelopes shows which money is available for each purpose before you spend. Savings is a purpose too: you don’t have to spend everything you assign.' },
  { q: 'Does zero ready to assign mean I’m out of money?', a: 'No. It means you’ve given all your available money a purpose. The money is still yours until you spend it. Check each envelope’s available balance to see what remains for that purpose.' },
  { q: 'What if my plans change?', a: 'Move available money from one envelope to another. Putting more into Food means choosing where it comes from, such as Fun. Your total money stays the same; your plan changes.' },
  { q: 'Is Aviary free?', a: 'Aviary is on a trial plan while payments are still being set up, so it’s free to use right now. You don’t need a payment card to get started. Once payments go live, you’ll get a full 45-day trial from that point, and we’ll tell you before it starts. We haven’t settled on a price yet, but it’ll be kept affordable. Aviary is also open source; you can inspect the code on GitHub.' },
  { q: 'Do I connect my bank? How do expenses get added?', a: 'There’s no bank connection. You log purchases yourself, which makes spending a deliberate check-in. Recurring expenses and receipt scanning help with repeated or longer entries. Transactions aren’t imported from your bank automatically.' },
  { q: 'Can I use it on my phone and computer?', a: 'Yes. Android and web share your account’s budgets and transactions. Android also offers a home-screen widget and notifications. New expenses can be logged offline on mobile and sync when you reconnect; other actions need a connection. There’s no published iPhone app; use the web version on iPhone.' },
  { q: 'What happens to my financial data?', a: <>Sensitive financial fields are encrypted in storage. The server decrypts them to run the app; this isn’t end-to-end encryption. Money Brain and AI briefs send relevant transaction and budget context to Google Gemini, and bill scanning sends receipt photos. You can export or delete your data in account settings. <Link href="/legal/privacy">Read the privacy policy</Link> for storage, analytics, and processing details.</> },
  { q: 'Can I use another currency?', a: 'Yes. Choose your display currency during setup or change it in More. One currency applies to your whole budget; changing it doesn’t convert amounts.' },
