      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      <p className="legal-updated">Last updated 4 September 2026</p>

      <p>
        These terms cover your use of Aviary, a personal budgeting app. By creating an account or using the
        app, you agree to them. If you don&apos;t agree, please don&apos;t use Aviary.
      </p>

      <h2>The service</h2>
      <p>
        Aviary helps you track envelopes, expenses, subscriptions, and investments for personal, non-commercial
        use. It&apos;s developed and operated by an individual, not a company, and offered as-is.
      </p>

      <h2>Eligibility</h2>
      <p>
        You must be 18 or older to use Aviary. By creating an account or using the app, you confirm that you
        are. If we learn that someone under 18 has an account, we may close it.
      </p>

      <h2>Your account</h2>
      <p>
        You need an account to use Aviary. You&apos;re responsible for keeping the device and email you sign
        in with secure. Tell us at {SUPPORT_EMAIL} if you believe your account has been accessed without your
        permission.
      </p>

      <h2>Subscriptions and billing</h2>
      <p>
        New accounts get a 45-day free trial that starts when you finish onboarding. No payment details are
        needed for the trial and it never charges you automatically. To keep using Aviary afterwards, you can
        buy a monthly or yearly subscription in the Android app through Google Play. Prices are shown in the
        app before you buy.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Renewal.</strong> Subscriptions renew automatically at the end of each monthly or yearly
          period until you cancel, and are charged to your Google Play account.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cancelling.</strong> Cancel any time in the Google Play Store app: Profile &rarr; Payments
          &amp; subscriptions &rarr; Subscriptions &rarr; Aviary &rarr; Cancel. You keep access until the end
          of the period you&apos;ve paid for. Deleting your Aviary account does not cancel a Google Play
          subscription.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Refunds.</strong> Payments are handled by Google Play, so refunds follow Google Play&apos;s
          refund policy. You can also write to {SUPPORT_EMAIL}.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>If a subscription ends.</strong> Your data is kept for 12 months and you can export it at any
          time, including after your subscription ends.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Price changes.</strong> If the price changes, Google Play will notify you before your next
          renewal.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Acceptable use</h2>
      <p>Don&apos;t use Aviary to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>resell or offer it as part of another commercial product,</li>
        <li>reverse engineer, scrape, or attempt to disrupt the service,</li>
        <li>upload unlawful content, or</li>
        <li>attempt to access another user&apos;s data.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>AI features</h2>
      <p>
        Money Brain, bill scanning, and AI-written notifications use a third-party AI model and are best-effort.
        They can be wrong, so double-check anything that matters before you act on it. Nothing Aviary generates
        is financial, tax, legal, or investment advice.
      </p>

      <h2>Third-party services</h2>
      <p>
        Aviary depends on services we don&apos;t control (sign-in, hosting, the AI model, push notifications).
        We aren&apos;t responsible for their outages or changes, though we&apos;ll do our best to keep the app
        working around them.
      </p>

      <h2>Your data</h2>
      <p>
        You own the data you enter. You can export or delete it at any time &mdash; see our{' '}
        <a href="/legal/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> for how, and our{' '}
        <a href="/legal/delete-account">account deletion page</a> for the deletion flow specifically.
      </p>

      <h2>Termination</h2>
      <p>
        You can delete your account whenever you like. We may suspend or terminate an account that violates
        these terms.
      </p>

      <h2>No warranty</h2>
      <p>
        Aviary is provided &ldquo;as is&rdquo;, without warranty of any kind, including accuracy, availability,
        or fitness for a particular purpose.
      </p>

      <h2>Limitation of liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the extent permitted by law, we aren&apos;t liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages
        arising from your use of Aviary, including decisions made based on its budgeting figures or AI output.
      </p>

      <h2>Governing law</h2>
      <p>These terms are governed by the laws of India, and any dispute will be subject to the jurisdiction of Indian courts.</p>

      <h2>Changes</h2>
      <p>We may update these terms from time to time; the date above reflects the latest revision.</p>
